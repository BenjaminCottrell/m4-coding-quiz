# m4-code-quiz

## Description

This application is a quiz that outputs a score based on your final time. Every time you choose an incorrect answer the timer drops by 10 seconds. It is primarily built with JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to learn to implement API's and advanced JS.
While building this project I learned how to:

- Create and run a timer
- Select elements by ID and create children elements for them
- Use CSS to style every nth child
- Use CSS: "display: none;" in order to hide divs and use JavaScript: ".classList.add() and .classList.remove()" to add and remove "hide" class
- Save a JSON file to local storage and pull its contents on another webpage
